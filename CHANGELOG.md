## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Open-source communication surface: roadmap, contributing guide, code of
  conduct, security policy, issue/PR templates, CI, and CODEOWNERS.
- `/ask` endpoint, minimal web UI, and `teamctx ask "<question>" [--role <slug>]`
  CLI command for asking questions grounded in team context.
- Manager approval queue: `teamctx contribute` now enqueues by default;
  `teamctx review list / approve / reject` CLI to gate contributions; rejected
  items archived under `.teamctx/rejected/` with an optional reason.
  `teamctx config manager <name>` sets an identity gate (unset = solo mode).
  New `--apply` flag on `contribute` preserves the old immediate-apply behaviour.

### Changed
- `teamctx contribute` no longer applies to shared context on submission by
  default — it enqueues under `.teamctx/queue/` and prints the review command.
  Pass `--apply` to keep the old behaviour.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- Initial release: `teamctx` CLI and Vercel API for AI-native team context.
